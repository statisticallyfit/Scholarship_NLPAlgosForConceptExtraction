\section{Discussion, Conclusion, and Future Work}\label{sec:ConcludeAndFuture}

\begin{itemize}
\item summarize what was written
-> machine translation (MT)
Did not expect this to be directly useful to my long term purpose of concept extraction (ml) but a good source of implementations
-> .... summarize

\item indicate future work directions
-> bayes polysemy
-> different representations: knowledge graph embeddings
-> model fine-tuning, transfer learning, domain adaptation for easier use.
-> more research into concept embeddings and key phrase extraction. 
\end{itemize}
